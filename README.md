## Introduction

ThreatHunter-CommandLine is a command-line tool developed by [tejenderthakur](https://github.com/tejender-lib) for scanning files and domains using the VirusTotal API. It provides an easy-to-use interface for security researchers, malware analysts, and cybersecurity professionals to analyze suspicious files and domains for potential threats.

## Features

- **File Scanning**: Scan individual files or entire folders for malware using the VirusTotal API.
- **Domain Scanning**: Scan single domains for malicious indicators using the VirusTotal API.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Execute malware samples in a controlled environment and monitor their behavior.
- **Static Analysis**: Disassemble and decompile malware binaries to understand their code structure and logic.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Capture and analyze network traffic generated by malware samples to extract indicators of compromise.
- **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports summarizing analysis results and threat intelligence data.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tejender-lib/ThreatHunter-CommandLine.git
